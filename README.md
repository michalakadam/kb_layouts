# Keyboard layouts

### 3x5+3 Colemak DH

Developed while using 3W6 - a split, columnar, 36 keys keyboard based on an open source design (https://github.com/weteor/3W6) and built by https://www.keebart.com

Contrary to a popular [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout it has:
- fewer layers (only 3) that are accessible from both thumbs. I find fewer layers easier to adapt to.
- function keys ordered ascendingly. 
- mouse left/right keys on the opposite hand wrt to the mouse movement keys.

[Home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) are used on each layer with right alt instead of the GUI key, as I sometimes write stuff in Polish.

##### Base layer

Using [Colemak DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) as a layout for a smooth typing experience.

##### Fun + num + symbols layer

Accessible by holding either of the LT2 keys in the base layer.
